        <h3>School Projects</h3>
        <div>
          <p><span>JSLang programming language</span> – 2018 – PLY, Python</p>
          Designed for a subject a language based on python with arrays like numpy, objects like javascript, and
          typing like JSCompiler. Implemented the compiler with PLY and the virtual machine to execute it.
        </div>
        <div>
          <p><span>MIPS 32 bits microprocessor</span> – 2018 – VHDL, MIPS32</p>
          Implemented in pairs a basic microprocessor of the MIPS 32 architecture fully operational with all its units
          like ALU, registers, control unit, etc., using VHDL in a Spartan 6, that can be programmed with assembly.

      <h3>External Projects</h3>
      <div>
        <p><span>RoboCup @Home prototype</span> – 2019 – ROS, TensorFlow, Raspberry Pi, Python, C++</p>
        Developed a prototype for competition of an autonomous humanoid that understands voice, recognizes
        objects, and answers was developed. Using ML models, sensors like LiDAR, and computer vision.
      </div>
      <div>
        <p><span>LARC: IEEE Open Challenge</span> – 3rd place – 2017 – Arduino, C++, Raspberry Pi, Python</p>
        Developed the logic, control systems, and communication to make our autonomous robot to find with
        computer vision the simulated-cows and milk them. This give us publish a Team Description Paper.
